Talk for this first meeting is:
- C++ as a scripting language

To use C++ in conjunction with a scripting language to get fast iterations in development is quite common.
What is not as common is to use C++ itself as a scripting language, which is a pity, as it turns out it's quite easy to achieve. Learn simple techniques for C++ hot reloading.

Olof Naessén is a Technical Director at Massive Entertainment during daytime, and a passionate 8-bit game developer at nighttime, and has been working with C++ for the last 8 years.
