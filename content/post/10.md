The Malmö C++ User Group is finishing its first year with a Quiz Night!

We will create a teams and try to answer as many C++ related questions as possible. Anything from normal language behavior, quirks, history and more.

After that we will end the meetup with pizza, drinks and the good old hangout and chat afterwards.
