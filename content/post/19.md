This months C++ meeting will be presented by Fabian.

GPUs allow programmers to launch thousands of threads and run software in a massively parallel fashion. During this talk, we will discuss both the software interface and hardware architecture of CUDA cards. Based on this discussion, we investigate how to re-write the time-honored mergesort algorithm.
