Talk for this meeting is:
- Don't trust the compiler to optimize

A walk-through and discussion of trivial code samples where compilers did or do generate anything from suboptimal to horribly badly performing code, illustrating the risks of relying on compiler optimizations. Examples will be primarily for x86_64 and gcc, even though any compiler has similar issues. Assembler code will be presented, so having looked at x86 assembler before would be useful but not necessary for understanding.

Reimar Döffinger is a software developer who a long time ago developed OpenSource multimedia software in C and assembler and now works a lot with C++ and thinking about how teams can be enabled to write better code. To compensate for all the sitting and thinking he spends a good bit of his free time organising hikes in the Skåne area.
