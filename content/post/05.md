Talk for this meeting is:
- Language Introduction and Resources to get started

C++ is often thought of as a scary language to start learning. In this meetup of the Malmö C++ User Group we will go over a short introduction of the language and go over many resources on how to get started in the world of C++

We will then have a Pizza break and a chat session where you can ask many of our established members questions you have regarding the language.
