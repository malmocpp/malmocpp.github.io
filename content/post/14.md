title: "Meeting 0xD - Strong types to write more comprehensible code"

An in depth example of making function calls and output parameters more readable with the help of strong types. While the C++ guidelines recommend avoiding output parameters, they are sometimes necessary when dealing with expensive to move types, or when modifying input data.

With strong typing and template deduction, you can make your function calls more readable, without sacrificing performance.

With an interest of exploring new toolsets and programming features, the only thing holding him back being increasing template compile times. When not programming, he can be found playing grindy videogames and pampering to spoiled parrots.
