Meetup of the Malmö C++ User Group.

Talk for this meeting is:
- Make the compiler sweat, chill in runtime

Modern C++ offers some powerful features for doing work in compile time instead of in runtime. We'll explore some of these features, for a faster, smaller and more correct runtime.

Simon Lindholm is an independent contractor, mostly working with Linux and various embedded platforms.
