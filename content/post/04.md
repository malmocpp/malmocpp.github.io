Talk for this meeting is:
- How compilers take advantage of undefined behavior

Modern C++ offers some powerful features for doing work in compile time instead of in runtime. We'll explore some of these features, for a faster, smaller and more correct runtime.

Krister Walfridsson got involved in GCC development as a student in the mid-90's, and have continued working on compilers since then.
