[The Game Assembly](https://www.thegameassembly.com/) is a school here in Malmö that offers educations for Game Programming, Game Art, Level Design and Technical art.

They use C++ heavily in teaching game programming and we will have a few students that are in their last year of studies that will present lightning talks about something that they have created or learned at the school.
